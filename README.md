# How to Build

Voodoo currently builds only on Windows. It would be great if somebody ported the build engine to Unix and Python, but until then, all instructions below assume you have a windows machine.

## Step 1: Install Python 2.7

  http://www.python.org/download/
  
## Step 2: Install Closure Linter

## Step 3: Install 7zip

## Step 4: Install Java 1.7 Runtime

## Step 4: Update tools\user.cmd

  Update this script with paths to your installations and browsers to test.

## Step 5: Build

  Run build.cmd in the root folder.
